# OpenAI API Experiment

This project is an experiment with the OpenAI API, a powerful artificial intelligence platform that provides access to state-of-the-art machine learning models.

The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of the OpenAI API by building a simple application that demonstrates its use. Specifically, we will be building a chatbot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user input.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to do the following:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI API key. You can do this on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/signup/).

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

4. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable by creating a `.env.local` file in the project directory and adding the following line: `OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>` and `OPEN_AI_ORG_ID=<your_open_ai_org_id_here>`. Be sure to replace `<your_api_key_here>` with your actual API key.

5. Run the application by running `npm run dev` in the project directory.

## Usage

Once you have the application up and running, you can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into the input field and pressing the "Submit" button. The chatbot will use the OpenAI API to generate a response to your message, which will be displayed in the chat window.

You can experiment with different types of messages to see how the chatbot responds. For example, you could try asking the chatbot a question or making a statement about a particular topic.
